# Assignment 2: Event Scheduling System

This project implements an **Event Scheduling System** (Subject #15) using Java. It demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and data management.

### Key Features:
* **Abstraction & Inheritance:** Utilizes an abstract `Person` class as a base for `Participant` and `Organizer`.
* **Encapsulation:** All data fields are private, with access managed via getters and setters.
* **Polymorphism:** Method overriding used for custom object information display.
* **Data Pool:** Implements an `ArrayList` to manage event objects.
* **Functionality:** Includes logic for sorting (by name), filtering (by location), and searching within the collection.
* **System Methods:** Overridden `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` for robust object comparison and formatting.
